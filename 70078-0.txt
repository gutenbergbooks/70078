DISSERTATION continued.


The unabating ardour that still prevails in the science of botany, and
rather increases than diminishes, renders it almost impossible (from the
extreme minutiæ annexed to this elegant tribe) for the pencil of the
artist to keep pace with the numerous importations from the Cape (at
present the sole emporium of the genus Erica): the limits of the genus
it is impossible at present to prescribe, but by the termination of the
next Volume we have no doubt of being able to ascertain, in some
measure, its extent. The Author’s intention is therefore to figure
(first) all the most elegant and desirable of the genus, including many
very beautiful varieties, of recent introduction, that far surpass those
from which they derive their name; reserving, as a dernier ressort, the
most uninteresting and least attractive, to subjoin at the termination
of the genus, as necessary links in the chain of this extensive family.
The great difficulty attending the cultivation of many of the species,
so generally complained of, can only be surmounted by great care and
attention to keep them from the partial damps and fogs so prevalent in
this island. Among the most tender and difficult to preserve, and which
require the most care are the E. obbata, E. retorta, E. ampullacea, E.
Aitonia., E. Jasminiflora, E. vestita alba, and E. Massonia; the last of
which is perhaps the most tender, owing most likely to the closeness of
the leaves, joined with the soft hairs that surround them, which is a
great encourager of secreted damps: this, assisted by the great
succulence that pervades the upper part of the plant, and its rather
abrupt commencement from the wood, renders it so difficult to be
preserved. They should by no means be intermixed with other plants, but
kept in a house entirely appropriated to them, and so arranged that the
air may have as free an egress and regress as possible to them all; as
undoubtedly the mixing of them with plants whose foliage is so much
larger, although it may produce a pleasing contrast, must exclude the
free approach of the atmosphere, to which they are so much exposed in
their native clime, and to which the nearest approximation must
certainly be most congenial.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™'s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
